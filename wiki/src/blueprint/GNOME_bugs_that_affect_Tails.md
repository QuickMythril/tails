Contributing to [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) is a great way to make
Tails better. To understand why we at Tails want to work closely with
our upstreams, see our
[[contribute/relationship_with_upstream]] statement.

<div class="note">

GNOME is in the process of migrating from Bugzilla to GitLab. So until
this migration is completed, some of the issues that affect Tails live
in their Bugzilla while some others are already on their GitLab.
