This is about migrating our data and workflow from Redmine to GitLab,
which is tracked as [[!tails_ticket 15878]].

[[!toc levels=3]]

<a id="access-control"></a>

# Access control

## Objects

 - _Canonical Git repo_: the authoritative `tails.git` repository
   hosted on GitLab

 - _Major branches_: `master`, `stable`, `testing`, `devel`,
   and possibly `feature/bullseye`

 - _Release tags_: a signed Git tag that identifies the source code
   used to build a specific Tails release; currently all tags
   in the authoritative `tails.git` repository are release tags;
   the tag name is a version number, with '~' replaced by '-'.

 - _Particularly sensitive data_: confidential data that specific teams
   like Fundraising and Accounting need to handle, but that other
   contributors generally don't need direct access to. This definitely
   include issues; this might include Git repositories at some point.

   Note that as of 2019-11-20, it is undefined:

    - What subset of this data can go to a web-based issue tracker or not.<br/>
      This is already a problem with Redmine.<br/>
      Fixing this will require discussions between various stakeholders.

    - What subset of this data could live in a cleartext Git
      repository hosted here or there, as opposed to requiring
      end-to-end encryption between members of these teams.
      This is a hypothetical problem for now.

## Subjects

 - An _admin_ can do anything that other roles can, and:
   - can delete issues
   - can edit team membership
   - MUST comply with our "Level 3" security policy
   - can view issues that contain particularly sensitive data
   - can create new groups and projects that are not forks

 - A _committer_:
   - can push and force-push to any ref in the canonical Git repo,
     including major branches and release tags;<br/>
     incidentally, this ensures the following requirement is met:
   - their branches are picked up by Jenkins; it follows that they
     MUST comply with our "Infrastructure" security policy
   - can merge MRs into major branches
   - can modify issues metadata
   - MAY be allowed to view confidential issues in the main GitLab
     project; if it's the case, then particularly sensitive data MUST
     live somewhere else with stricter access control
   - can edit other users' comments
   - MAY be allowed to add new team members
   - MUST comply with our "Level 3" security policy

 - A _regular, particularly trusted contributor_:
   - can push and force-push to a subset of refs in the canonical Git repo;
     this subset MUST NOT include any major branch nor release tag;<br/>
     this is required to ensure the following requirement is met:
   - their branches are picked up by Jenkins; it follows that they
     MUST comply with our "Infrastructure" security policy
   - can modify issues metadata
   - MAY be allowed to view confidential issues in the main GitLab
     project; if it's the case, then particularly sensitive data MUST
     live somewhere else with stricter access control

 - A _regular contributor_:
   - can fork the Git repositories and push changes to their own fork
   - can modify issues metadata
   - MAY be allowed to view confidential issues in the main GitLab
     project; if it's the case, then particularly sensitive data MUST
     live somewhere else with stricter access control

 - _Anybody with a GitLab account_ on the instance we use:
   - can submit issues
   - can submit MRs

## Implementation

### Relevant GitLab doc

 - [Permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)
 - [Authorization for Merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/merge_requests/authorization_for_merge_requests.html)
 - [Protected Branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/protected_branches.html)
 - [Groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/) and [Subgroups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/subgroups/)

### Common settings

 - pipelines: disabled
 - wiki: disabled

### The parent "tails" group

 - Visibility: Public
 - The `root` user has "Owner" access to this group.
 - Release managers have "Reporter" access to every project in this group
   (after releasing a new Tails, they need to postpone issues,
   including confidential ones, and manage group labels),
   until [[!tails_ticket 17589]] is done.
 - Nobody else is a member of this group.
 - Allow users to request access: disabled

### Most public projects

The following applies to each of our public project that
has no dedicated section below:

 - [Protected branch flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/merge_requests/authorization_for_merge_requests.html#protected-branch-flow):
   it's the most adequate for regular contributors, since it's the
   least disruptive in terms of workflow and habits and requires no
   work to adjust our Jenkins CI setup.
 - We mark our major branches as "Protected".
 - Committers get "Maintainer" access.
 - Maintainers are allowed to merge and to push to
   protected branches.
 - The Git workflow remains unchanged for regular developers who are
   not granted full commit access but have access to our CI:
   they get "Developer" access, can
   push a topic branch to the canonical Git repository and our CI will
   pick it up. The only difference is that they are not restricted to
   pushing to their own `$nickname/*` namespace, which makes things
   simpler and has other advantages, e.g. they can use the `wip/`
   prefix (so our Jenkins CI ignores the branch) and collaborate with
   others on shared branches.
 - Other contributors get access strictly lower than "Developer".
   They push topic branches to their own fork of the repository and
   create merge requests.
 - Our current Jenkins CI jobs generation process remains unchanged.
   (Technically, we could adjust it so it generates CI jobs for _any_
   merge request (based on `refs/merge-requests/*/head`), but this
   would give arbitrary code execution on our CI to _anyone_.
   Our infrastructure is not currently equipped to cope with this.)

## Management

With Redmine + Gitolite, we centrally manage, in 1-2 single places, team
membership and the corresponding access level. For example, when someone gets
commit access or joins a team, we add them to the corresponding Gitolite group
and Redmine role. That's very convenient.

If we don't do anything special, to implement the access control specified
above, we would need to:

* During the migration to GitLab: give dozens of users "Reporter", "Maintainer"
  or "Developer" access on dozens of project.
* Day-to-day operations: occasionally, give someone "Reporter", "Maintainer" or
  "Developer" access on dozens of project.

I don't think we want to do any of this manually.

It seems we could maintain user groups via the GitLab web interface and [share
the relevant projects with these user
groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/members/share_project_with_groups.html).
These groups would not contain any project themselves: their primary purpose is to
manage access to projects in batch.

And in passing, such user groups would allow us to mention a team with one
single `@xyz-team` or `@xyz-group`. For example, `@sysadmins-team`.

Another option would be to use
[subgroups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/group/subgroups/), and have for
example `tails/accounting-team/accounting`, but references to issues etc.
become pretty long, e.g. "tails/accounting-team/accounting#1234", compared to
"tails/accounting#1234" in the current implementation. Unless there's a way
around this problem, that's a usability deal breaker and we should not use
subgroups merely to simplify access level management.

# Wiki

It's out of scope for the first iteration but at some point, we might
want to migrate our blueprints to GitLab's
[wiki](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/wiki/):
[[!tails_ticket 9174]]).

<a id="git"></a>

# Git repositories

Migration includes preserving access rights, which are documented
for each repository below.

## Must be migrated

From `git.tails.boum.org` aka. `git-tails.immerda.ch`:

 - `bitcoin` (public; read-write: sysadmins)
 - `bitcoin_libunivalue` (public; read-write: sysadmins)

Read-only mirrors to be migrated from `git.tails.boum.org` aka.
`git-tails.immerda.ch` (with a description that makes it clear
to people with commit access that it's a read-only mirror):

 - public `puppet-*` (public; read-write: role-lizard)
 - `jenkins-jobs` (public; read-write: role-lizard)

## Leave on immerda for now

 - `download-and-verify-extension`: obsolete
 - `iceweasel`: very big, unused since years
 - `thunderbird`: very big, hopefully obsolete soon
 - `uui-binary`: obsolete

<a id="interfaces"></a>

# Interfaces that will need adjustments

## Git repository â†’ various mirrors

Our Git repository keeps a number of mirrors up-to-date:

 - <https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/gitolite/install_remotes.sh>
 - <https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/gitolite/install_hooks.sh>

In particular:

 - repositories that must now be mirrored on our GitLab
   (in addition to, or instead of, the current immerda remote):
    - public `puppet-*`
    - `jenkins-jobs`

## Git repositories â†’ website

A refresh of our website is triggered by:

 - pushing to the master branch of our Git repository
 - pushing to a few "underlay" repositories

Current implementation:

 - <https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/gitolite/install_hooks.sh>
 - <https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/gitolite/hooks/www_website_ping-post-update.hook>
 - <https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/gitolite/hooks/www_website_underlays-post-update.hook>
 - <https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/templates/website/update-underlays.erb>

## Git repository â†’ Jenkins

Pushing to our Git repository pings Jenkins so it can run jobs as needed:
<https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/templates/gitolite/hooks/tails-post-receive.erb>

<a id="interfaces-jenkins-git"></a>

## Jenkins â†’ Git

Jenkins jobs are generated on `jenkins.lizard`, from the list of
branches in our main Git repository. For details and pointers to the
corresponding code, see the corresponding
[[blueprint|automated_builds_and_tests/jenkins]].

Here are the kinds of jobs relevant in this discussion:

 - `check_PO_master` runs the `check_po` script on all PO files

    - this script comes from a Git submodule referenced by
      `tails.git`'s master branch (`tails::tester::check_po`)
    - in a Jenkins isobuilder
    - as a sudoer user

 - `build_website_master` runs `./build-website`

    - from `tails.git`'s master branch
    - in a Jenkins isobuilder
    - as a sudoer user

 - `build_Tails_ISO_*` and `reproducibly_build_Tails_ISO_*` run
   `rake build`

    - from the corresponding `tails.git` branch
    - in a Jenkins isobuilder
    - as a sudoer user

 - `test_Tails_ISO_*` run `./run_test_suite`

    - from the corresponding `tails.git` branch
    - in a Jenkins isotester
    - as root via sudo

Wrt. who can push to which branch in `tails.git`, see the "Access control"
section.

## Jenkins â†’ Redmine

Tails images build reproducibility is tested if the corresponding
ticket has "Needs Validation" status:
<https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/jenkins/slaves/isobuilders/decide_if_reproduce>

(Currently disabled:) Email notifications are sent on job status
change if the ticket has "Needs Validation" status:
<https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/jenkins/slaves/isobuilders/output_ISO_builds_and_tests_notifications>

## Ticket triaging â†’ Redmine

Our Redmine email reminder sends email to users who have at least one
ticket assigned to them, that satisfies at least one of these criteria:

 - "Stalled work-in-progress": status "In Progress", that were
   not updated since more than 6 months

 - "Reviews waiting for a long time": not been updated since 45 days
   or more

Current implementation:

 - <https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/redmine/reminder/redmine-remind>
 - <https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/redmine/reminder/email_body>
 - <https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/manifests/redmine/reminder.pp>

With GitLab one can define policies (YAML) and have them applied automatically
to issues and merge requests:

  - <https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#triage-automation>
  - <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops>
  - <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-triage>

Potential future work: [[!tails_ticket 17589]].

## Translation platform â†’ Git

A hook ensures that Weblate only pushes changes to our main Git
repository that meet certain conditions:

<https://git.tails.boum.org/puppet-tails/tree/files/gitolite/hooks/tails-weblate-update.hook>
