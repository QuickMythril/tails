* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Release management
------------------

A year ago, when we learned we had to switch to a 4-weeks release cycle to
follow Mozilla's lead, we acknowledged that the need to streamline our release
process, in order to make this part of our work more sustainable. In November,
the Tails Release Managers team had a sprint focused on this very topic, during
which we identified a great number of issues and fixed most of them! :)

For details, read the [sprint
report](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20201116.132555.7bc56b9c.en.html).

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We had a meeting to prioritize & organize work on our next big things.
  We decided to first focus on:

  - Wayland blockers, that can be addressed incrementally.

  - Deal with deprecation of Tor Launcher ([[!tails_ticket 17215]])

  - Rewrite Persistent Storage GUI frontend ([[!tails_ticket 17803]]

- We scheduled a sprint in January to bootstrap our work on the RIPE
  grant and on Wayland blockers.

- We re-bootstrapped our experiment on sharing our team's "front desk" workload.

- We started reorganizing our team meetings.

- We now require Debian 10 "Buster" or newer for running our test suite
  ([[!tails_ticket 17842]]), and started to take benefit from this change.

- We automated a great part of the tests we do as part of release
  quality assurance.

Documentation and website
=========================

- Planned the [[!tails_ticket 16128 desc="deprecation of the Tails
  Verification extension"]]. We will publish a [[!tails_gitweb_commit b6d965c1f5
  desc="deprecation notice on /news"]] and remove the extension from app
  stores a few weeks later.

- Documented how to use [[GMail in
  Thunderbird|doc/anonymous_internet/thunderbird#gmail]].
  ([[!tails_ticket 17879]])

- Explained why is a [[bad idea to use an old version of
  Tails|support/faq#older-version]] in the FAQ. ([[!tails_ticket 18001]])

- Recommended [[doing backups|install/win/usb#recommendations]] at the end of
  our installation instructions. ([[!tails_ticket 18000]])

- Decided to remove */support/learn*. ([[!tails_ticket 17920]])

- Updated our doc to Thunderbird 78 and wrote [[migration
  instructions|doc/anonymous_internet/thunderbird/openpgp_migration]].
  ([[!tails_ticket 17147]])

Infrastructure
==============

Funding
=======

- The first numbers that we could analyze for the donation campaign look
  very promising compared to the same period last year:

  * PayPal: 34% more donations, 28% more money
  * Bitcoin: 62% more donations
  * Monero: 205% more donations

- We programmed our biggest Twitter campaign ever: 34 tweets, 1 tweet
  every 2 days at most. Half of them are not direct calls to donate but
  rather build up on the new  Home and About pages to talk about the
  main properties of Tails.

- We decided not to blog about the donation campaign for now because our
  team is seriously overworked. It doesn't seem to have impacted the
  campaign significantly. We might still blog about achievements and
  plans in December.

- Our grant to RIPE on [improving Tails for censorship
  circumvention](https://www.ripe.net/support/cpf/funding-recipients-2020)
  was approved.
