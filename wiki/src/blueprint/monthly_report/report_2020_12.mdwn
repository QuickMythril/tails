ðŸŽ‰ New core developer ðŸŽ‚
========================

Today, we celebrate the arrival in our [[Foundations
Team|contribute/working_together/roles/foundations_team]] of a new member:
boyska. His skills and experience in operating systems, software development,
and collective projects will:

 - Accelerate development of new features, user experience improvements, and
   bug fixes.

 - Make our day-to-day maintenance work more sustainable.

   This work has no visible impact most of the time, except that Tails is still
   alive after more than a decade, and here to stay!

 - Decrease our reliance on a tiny number of key persons.

   This is one important step we're taking, among others, towards making Tails
   a healthier project.

> I'm boyska, a fellow who always loved technology. When I realized the

> that's how I got involved with free software, security and hacking in
> general.
> A post-it note in my brain remembers me that computers should be fun,
> not scary.


Additionally, we would like to thank:

 - the thousands of people whose donation allowed us to fund this new position

   Please consider [[donating today|donate]] to fight surveillance and censorship.

 - the dozens of people who applied to this [[job offer|jobs/Linux_generalist]]

   It's been truly heart-warming to see so many great applicants
   interested in working with us.

Welcome, boyska! :)
