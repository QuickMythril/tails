Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ((emergency release)?).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers, foundation team, and RMs don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

Documentation and website
=========================

XXX: If you feel like it and technical writers don't do it
     themselves, explore the Git history:

         git log --patch --since='1 October' --until='1 November' origin/master -- "doc**.*m*" "about**.*m*" "support**.*m*" "install**.*m*" "upgrade**.*m*"

User experience
===============

XXX: If you feel like it and the UX team does not do it
     themselves, check the archives of tails-ux:
     <https://lists.autistici.org/list/tails-XXX.html>

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. A lot of people reached the helpdesk complaining about JavaScript not being disabled by Tor Browser's safest mode anymore ([[NoScript is doing that job now|https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/40082]] [[as it should|https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/33613]]),

1. people are still affected (and will be until the [[!tails_ticket 17896 desc="kernel is upgraded to 5.8 branch"]]) by a [[!tails_ticket 17953 desc="regression with some Intel GPU"]],

1. another regression [[!tails_ticket 17955 desc="affecting some Acer and Asus laptops"]] was reported since the release of Tails 4.11,

1. and people are still regularly complaining about [[!tails_ticket 17183 desc="Seahorse failing to import public keys"]].
 
Also, it seemed important to the helpdesk team to remind Tails' users that we are not responsible for the cosmetic changes made upstream (e.g. the handling of JavaScript in Tor Browser, or the new Firefox URL bar that received a lot of comments from users on our helpdesk as well as tor project's). Any thoughts on those changes should be done directly to the people working on them. 


Infrastructure
