Releases
========

* [[Tails 4.11 was released on September 22|news/version_4.11]].

* Tails 4.12 is [[scheduled for October 20|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 4.11:

- We added a new feature of the Persistent Storage to save the settings
  from the Welcome Screen: language, keyboard, and additional settings.

- Configure *KeePassXC* to use the new default location *Passwords.kdbx*. ([[!tails_ticket 17286]])

- Update <span class="code">python3-trezor</span> to 0.12.2 to add
  compatibility with the new Trezor Model T.

  To restore your settings when starting Tails, unlock your Persistent Storage
  in the Welcome Screen.

- Disable the feature to **Turn on Wi-Fi Hotspot** in the Wi-Fi settings
  because it doesn't work in Tails. ([[!tails_ticket 17887]])

Code
====

- Completed an effort started 14 months ago to move our custom software to our
  main Git repository ([[!tails_ticket 7036]]), in order to streamline Tails
  development work:
  - Tails Installer ([[!tails_ticket 17917]])
  - WhisperBack ([[!tails_ticket 16936]])

- Ported Perl code to translatable strings format supported by GNU gettext
  ([[!tails_ticket 17928]]), which will then allow us to benefit from [brand
  new `i18nspector` checks](https://github.com/jwilk/i18nspector/issues/6),
  avoiding some classes of Tails bugs caused by buggy translations

- Upgraded to tor 0.4.4 ([[!tails_ticket 17932]])

- Settled on a new policy for kernel updates, that balances rapid hardware
  enablement with lower risk of regressions ([[!tails_ticket 17911]])

Documentation and website
=========================

XXX: If you feel like it and technical writers don't do it
     themselves, explore the Git history:

         git log --patch --since='1 October' --until='1 November' origin/master -- "doc**.*m*" "about**.*m*" "support**.*m*" "install**.*m*" "upgrade**.*m*"

User experience
===============

XXX: If you feel like it and the UX team does not do it
     themselves, check the archives of tails-ux:
     <https://lists.autistici.org/list/tails-XXX.html>

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. A lot of people reached the helpdesk complaining about JavaScript not being disabled by Tor Browser's safest mode anymore ([[NoScript is doing that job now|https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/40082]] [[as it should|https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/33613]]),

1. people are still affected (and will be until the [[!tails_ticket 17896 desc="kernel is upgraded to 5.8 branch"]]) by a [[!tails_ticket 17953 desc="regression with some Intel GPU"]],

1. another regression [[!tails_ticket 17955 desc="affecting some Acer and Asus laptops"]] was reported since the release of Tails 4.11,

1. and people are still regularly complaining about [[!tails_ticket 17183 desc="Seahorse failing to import public keys"]].
 
Also, it seemed important to the helpdesk team to remind Tails' users that we are not responsible for the cosmetic changes made upstream (e.g. the handling of JavaScript in Tor Browser, or the new Firefox URL bar that received a lot of comments from users on our helpdesk as well as tor project's). Any thoughts on those changes should be done directly to the people working on them.
