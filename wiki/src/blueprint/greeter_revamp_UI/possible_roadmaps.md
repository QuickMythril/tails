anymore.*

Possible roadmaps
=================

0. **DONE** Decide what DM and language / UI toolkit we will use for the
   greeter in Wheezy
0. **DONE** Adapt following plans accordingly
0. **DONE** Gather more input from people who have strong opinions about the
   t-g UX: the idea is to encourage work on the greeter by bringing
   early positive input rather than late negative feedback.
   This should happen in [the dedicated
   thread](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-October/001781.html).
0. **DONE** Clarify specifications (see the [[blueprint/greeter_revamp_UI/design_rationale_phase1/]])
   0. **DONE** research a bit the pending questions
   0. **DONE** raise these topics for discussion among Tails developers
0. **DONE** Implement plan A or plan B. Incremental UI changes (plan 1) was choosen
0. Update documentation
0. Send software and documentation for translation on tails-l10n

Plan A - incremental UI changes
-------------------------------

The idea is to draft a new possible version first, and then we can
decide whether we want to ship it right away, or create other options
and benchmark them through a full-blown usability study.
Alan committed to lots of things in this plan, but not to
any deadline.

0. **DONE** Ask for ideas
0. **DONE** Propose one or several prototypes
0. **DONE** Make some testing happen by various kinds of
   users
0. **DONE** Extract something useful from the result
0. Implement the chosen proposal in a dedicated branch of the greeter
   repo

Plan B - full UI rewrite with usability study
---------------------------------------------

0. Design and sketch prototypes
0. Organize a usability study
0. Implement the winner idea
