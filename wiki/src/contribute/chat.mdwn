[[!meta title="Contributors chat"]]

In addition to the [[tails general chatroom|support/chat]],
we have a dedicated chatroom for contributors.

To join it, use your preferred instant messaging client that supports XMPP, e.g.
[[Pidgin|http://www.pidgin.im/]], which runs on Windows, GNU/Linux and
macOS.

Here are the needed technical details:

* protocol: XMPP
* server: `chat.disroot.org`
* channel: `tails-dev`
* Use TLS/SSL to connect!

Updated: 
2021-07-30 we dismiss the channel in riseup server, because they [[deprecated the service|https://riseup.net/en/chat]].
