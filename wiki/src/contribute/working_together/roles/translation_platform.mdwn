[[!meta title="Translation platform maintainers"]]


([[!tails_ticket 17050]]).

The general mission of this maintainers is **to make sure that Tails
translators can translate our website easily, while not compromising the safety
of the rest of the Tails ecosystem**. More specifically:

**Team responsabilities**:

* Manage the budget for this team/job.
* Keep track of upcoming big changes (e.g. Weblate dropping support for the
  database we're using, or gaining extra non-trivial dependencies) and plan
  the work we'll have to do to adjust.
* Refine and update the translation workflow.

**Backend responsibilities**:

* Maintain and upgrade Weblate.
* Maintain and improve the integration with main website.
* Maintain and improve the generation of the staging website.
* Maintain technical documentation up-to-date.
* Monitor error messages (Weblate, server, integrations).
* Implement backend changes needed for the translation workflow.
* Fix crashes in the whole setup.

**Frontend responsibilities**:

* Facilitate the process of adding new languages for translation:
  * Induction of new language teams if no Tails translator takes the lead.
  * Final, more technical review when new languages are deemed ready (make sure
    that the new translation does not break the website).
* Hear feedback from translators, facilitate these discussions until they reach a conclusion, and report to upstream when needed.
* Grant reviewer permissions (following our documented process).
    Update documentation for translators.
