# How to join the Spanish translation team?

We have one main communication channel: the **[mailing
list](https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-l10n-spanish)**.
Is important to join the list so we can organize together.
This list has a low volume of messages and is the place to solve your doubts or
share your ideas with other translators. Please introduce yourself to the list
when joining.

You can also join the [localization mailing list for all languages](https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-l10n)

# How to translate

* We try to translate using Tails itself so we get familiarised with the
  software we are translating.
* We have one main communication channel: A [mailing list](https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-l10n-spanish)
  (<tails-l10n-spanish@boum.org>).
* We have a wiki: [[!tails_blueprint l10n_Spanish]].
* We use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) for the translations (comes with Tails).
* The first documents to translate should be the
  [[core pages|contribute/l10n_tricks/core_po_files.txt]].

If you want to contribute, please contact us first through the mailing list.
