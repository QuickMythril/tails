<h1 id="issues">Known issues</h1>

Recently, a [serious kernel vulnerability](https://lwn.net/Articles/911062/) has been discovered in the Linux
kernel. This is currently exploitable in Tails.

See the list of [[long-standing issues|support/known_issues]].

<h1 id="get">Get Tails 5.5</h1>

## To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your persistent storage

- Automatic upgrades are available from Tails 5.0 or later to 5.5.

  You can [[reduce the size of the download|doc/upgrade#reduce]] of future
  automatic upgrades by doing a manual upgrade to the latest version.

- If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an
  automatic upgrade, please try to do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade/#manual]].

  - [[Install from Windows|install/windows]]

<div class="caution"><p>The Persistent Storage on the USB stick will be lost if
