A power glitch in one of the many Power Distribution Units on the rack where
our server is hosted caused it to reboot and become offline from Friday April
30th at 19:09:29 until Monday May 3rd at 05:58:33 (times are UTC). The reasons
why it took so much time to bring it back online were mainly that our
notification e-mail messages were only being routed through that very same
server and that the mobile device notifications were not configured properly.

The outage unfortunately impacted all Tails users because, at the very least,
their Tails wasn't able to upgrade and the Tails webpage wouldn't show up when
they started their web browsers. We're sorry for that, and we're taking
measures to avoid such long delay from happening again by building alternative
routes for the monitoring notification e-mails, fixing notifications on mobile
devices, and sharing sysadmins' mobile contacts with a broader set of people in
the Tails team.

The systems outage also caused fear that the Tails infrastructure could've gone
under an attack of some sort. This does not seem to have been the case. The
actual reasons for the power glitch are still being investigated, but all
indicates that it was a hardware failure and there are no signs of malicious
activity whatsoever.

Sorry for the inconveniences!
The Tails Sysadmins
