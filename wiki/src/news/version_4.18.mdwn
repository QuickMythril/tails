<h1 id="upgrades">Clarified user notifications</h1>

- Display an error message when the Upgrader fails to download the signing key. ([[!tails_ticket 18238]])

- Remove "clock synchronization" notification from Tor use.

  We removed this notification because it didn't recommend a specific action for users to take and it was confusing. It might have given users the impression that they should alter their UTC clock settings. ([[!tails_ticket 7439]])

<h1 id="changes">Other changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [10.0.15](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-10015).

- Update *Thunderbird* to [78.9.0â€“1](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.9.1/releasenotes/).

- Remove Poedit

  We now use Weblate to provide translated text for Tails and the Tails website, so Poedit isn't necessary anymore. ([[!tails_ticket 18236]])

- Update some Intel and Linux firmware packages.

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

- Use more reliable HTTPS sources for Debian's APT repository

  We now use non-onion HTTPS sources for the repositories, for increased reliability. We left other Tails and Tor Project APT onion sources as is. ([[!tails_ticket 17993]])

- Replace Mergebasebranch method

  A Rake build in non-base branches used to run *before* a base branch merge, creating a confused Git state. Builds now bypass the Mergebasebranch method. ([[!tails_ticket 12557]])
