<h1 id="new">What's new in 4.22~rc1?</h1>

Tails 4.22, scheduled for release on September 7, will allow users to
manually set the time of their computer's hardware clock. This addresses a
long-standing issue of Tails not being able to connect to Tor when obfs4
bridges are being used on a computer that has a hardware clock that is east
from UTC. [[!tails_ticket 15548]]

Also, Tails 4.22 will allow users to save bridges in Persistent Storage so
that the bridges do not need to be reentered every time Tails is restarted.

<h1>What's new since 4.21?</h1>

- Update *Thunderbird* to [78.13](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.13.0/releasenotes/)

- Tor Connection assistant will stop trying to connect to Tor when the error
  screen is displayed.

- Offline documentation includes the Russian language translation.

For more details, read our
[changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/raw/4.22-rc1/debian/changelog).

<h1 id="how-to-test">What to test in Tails 4.22~rc1?</h1>

We particularly would like to know if Tails can successfully connect to Tor
using bridges when the hardware clock is set from within Tor Connection
assistant.

Also, we want to make sure that bridges are properly saved and restored.

Tell us if anything is unclear, confusing, or not working as you would expect.

Please, send your feedback to <tails-testers@boum.org> (public mailing list).

If you are comfortable with the command line, check our [hacking
tips](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/devel/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/doc/tails/tca/HACKING.md).
They contain firewall rules that can be used to block access to the Tor network
without bridges or simulate a broken bridge.

<h1 id="known-issues">Known issues in 4.22~rc1</h1>

None specific to this release.

Happy testing!
