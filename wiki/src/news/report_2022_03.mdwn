[[!toc]]

We've been working hard on the new Persistent Storage implementation
([[!tails_gitlab tails/tails/issues/17803]]) and on the upgrade of Tails to
Debian 11 Bullseye (see [[!tails_gitlab groups/tails/-/milestones/20#tab-issues
desc="the corresponding milestone"]] to track progress).

Online trainings in [[Mexico|news/ciclo_de_autodefensa_digital_mexico/]] and
[[Brazil|news/ciclo_de_autodefensa_digital_brasil/]] were prepared and
conducted, and you can check out [the nice
slides](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/promote/material/slides/Ciclo_Autodefensa_Digital_202204/Tails-Spanish.odp)
that were used.

We [[interviewed Daniel
Mo√übrucker|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/daniel/]], who used Tails
to investigate pedocriminal forums on the Darknet and took down 13.5 terabytes
of photos and videos of child abuse.

Our page about [[trusting Tails|doc/about/trust/]] was entirely rewritten and
we have a new [[FAQ about VoIP|support/faq/#voip]].
