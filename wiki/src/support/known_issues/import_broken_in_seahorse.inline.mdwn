Importing OpenPGP public keys using the *Passwords and Keys* utility is broken
since Tails 4.0 (October 2019). This will be fixed in Tails 5.0 (May 2022).

Do so from the *Files* browser instead:

1. Choose **Applications**&nbsp;â–¸ **Files** to open the *Files* browser.

1. Double-click on the OpenPGP public
   key that you downloaded. The key must be in the *armored* format,
   usually with a `.asc` extension.

1. Choose **Open With Import Key**.

1. The imported OpenPGP public key does not appear in the *Passwords and Keys*
   utility. But, the key should appear in the list of keys available for encryption when
   [[encrypting text with a public key|doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/public-key_cryptography]]
   using *OpenPGP Applet*.
