Standard reply
==============

Dear Tails user,

We are a very small team working on very limited human resources, so
we may not be able to reply to every request we
receive, or, we may not reply in a timely manner. In advance, we
apologize for that.

In the meantime, you can find many resources on our support page:

https://tails.boum.org/support

There, you can find links to our complete documentation, FAQ
and our list of known issues, which includes a page dedicated to graphics
card issues.

We will need more information from you in 2 cases:

- **If this problem did not happen with an older version of Tails**:

  Please tell us which older version worked better.

- **If you find a way to work around the problem**:

  Please tell us, and we will document it so that other affected users benefit from your findings.

It is difficult to investigate most problems without having access
to the affected computer. Furthermore, even if we managed to investigate
each problem, unfortunately we often wouldn't be able to solve them.

For most issues, our best hope is usually that a future Linux driver update solves the
problem. For advanced Linux users: if you want to dig deeper on your own, you can
take it upstream after reproducing the issue on a recent, non-Tails Linux system.

If your issue is related to Tor Browser or the Tor network in general, please refer
to the support portal of Tor project: https://support.torproject.org/.

If your issue is related to software included in Tails, please consider
contacting their support channels.

Thank you for your understanding, and have a very nice day.

Hardware support reports we can't help with
===========================================

Dear Tails user,

Thank you for sharing your experience with us. We are sorry that Tails does not
work well on this computer.

It is difficult to investigate most hardware problems without having access
to the affected computer. Furthermore, even if we managed to investigate
each problem, unfortunately we often wouldn't be able to solve them.

If you have not yet, please read our support page:
https://tails.boum.org/support/

We will need more information from you in 2 cases:

- **If this problem did not happen with an older version of Tails**:

  Please tell us which older version worked better.

- **If you find a way to workaround the problem**:

  Please tell us, and we will document it so that other affected users benefit from your findings.

Our best hope is usually that a future Linux driver update solves the
problem. For advanced Linux users: if you want to dig deeper on your own, you can
take it upstream after reproducing the issue on a recent, non-Tails Linux system.

Thank you for your understanding :)

Reply for users who repeatedly treat us as search engines
=========================================================

> This reply is not advisable for first time reports, only for
> users that keep asking questions already covered by our
> documentation.

We are a very small team working on very limited human resources. A lot
of other people are asking for our help on our various support channels.
User support is an important task and is high in our priorities.

But all the time that we spend on user support is time that we cannot
dedicate to improving Tails itself. Please take this into
consideration when writing to us...

Not a Tails-dev question
========================

This is the mailing-list for Tails development.
For usage and support questions, please see instead:

https://tails.boum.org/support/

Thanks!

No OpenPGP key on the keyservers
================================

We could not find an OpenPGP key corresponding to this email address on the keyservers.
Please send us a valid public OpenPGP key, or publish it to the keyservers
and notify us when you do.

Thanks!

How to collaborate with Tails
============================

Hi,

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tails. As a community project,
we welcome contributions in many forms, from programming to writing and translating.

Please see our guide to learn how you can contribute:

Cheers,

Tails mirror is broken or scary SSL message
===========================================

Thank you for reporting this. We have transferred these details to the team that works on this at tails-mirrors@boum.org.

Requesting feedback on GitLab issues
====================================

## Known issue where we need feedback

Thank you for your report.

I think that you are experiencing an issue that has already been reported:

INSERT LINK TO ISSUE

Can you confirm if your issue is the same and provide feedback to the GitLab issue?


## Asking a user to reproduce the issue with Debian-live

Could you try to start a live version of Debian on your computer and
see if you can reproduce the issue?

Please read our instructions on how to reproduce bugs in Debian:

https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/#debian

With your help, this issue can hopefully be fixed in a future
version of Linux and thus Tails.

Thanks in advance!
