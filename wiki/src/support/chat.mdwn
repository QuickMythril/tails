Join our XMPP chat room to ask questions about Tails.

To do so, you need an XMPP account. Some email providers, such as
[Riseup](https://riseup.net/en/chat), provide XMPP accounts as well.

Then configure your preferred instant messaging client, for example
[[Pidgin|http://www.pidgin.im/]], which runs on Windows, GNU/Linux, and
macOS. You can also find information about configurations and other clients, web client 
and accounts, here: [[https://disroot.org/en/services/xmpp|https://disroot.org/en/services/xmpp]]

Here are the needed technical details:

* server: `chat.disroot.org`
* room: `tails`
* Use TLS/SSL to connect!
