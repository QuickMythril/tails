Summary
=======

Tails, a portable operating system that protects against surveillance and
censorship, is looking for a project manager to make our organization
function better.

In the last 12 years, from an initial tiny volunteer-run Free Software project,
Tails has grown to a setup in which almost all the work is done by paid workers,
with a 350kâ‚¬ yearly budget. This allowed us to increase by several orders of
magnitude the quality and pace of development of our product.

However, this growth happened faster than the corresponding, necessary increase
of our organization & social skills and capacity. As a result, lots of the
organization and social work still relies on the founders of the project.

It's time to fix this. We need help to give our project the means to
thrive sustainably.
