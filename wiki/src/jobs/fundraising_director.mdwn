Summary
=======

Tails, a portable operating system that protects against surveillance and
censorship, is looking for a Fundraising Director to help us develop and grow our
fundraising initiatives.

We are looking for a gifted communicator who can tell the story of Tails to a
wide variety of different current and potential future donors. You'll take the
lead on all fundraising efforts from strategy through to execution, and play a
key role in ensuring the financial health and sustainability of the project.
This role will work closely with our core teams to connect our technical &
product strategy to funding opportunities.

We already have experience raising a [[yearly budget|doc/about/finances]] of
around $400k from small donors, public grants, and private foundations. But our
team is growing and we are creating this new role to make our growth
sustainable. You will have the autonomy to further develop and rethink in depth
how Tails funds its work.

Key responsibilities

**Donor relationship management:**

- Recruit, cultivate, and steward both small and major donors.
  Create and manage a donor recognition and stewardship program. (note: I
  assume we don't really have one now?)

  The exact scope of your responsibilities will depend on how much
