<p>Today, we are asking you to help Tails. Everybody can get Tails for free
because we believe that nobody should have to pay to be safe while using
computers. And we will keep it this way, with your support.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">If
everyone reading this gave $5, our fundraiser would be done in one
day.</span> The price of a USB stick is all we need.</p>

<p>But, not everyone can donate. So when you do, you are offering to many
others who need it, this precious tool that is Tails.</p>
