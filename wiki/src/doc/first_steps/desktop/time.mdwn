[[!meta title="Why is the time wrong?"]]

When Tails starts, the system timezone is set to UTC (Greenwich time). So, this time
might be a few hours in the future if you are west of the United
Kingdom, or in the past if you are east of the UK. The minutes
should be accurate.

We do this for anonymity reasons: if some application reveals your actual
timezone, it might help identifying who you are.

Having all Tails users set to the same timezone, makes it more difficult to
distinguish you amongst all the other Tails users.

<div class="note">

We are working on a custom clock applet with configurable timezone. See
[[!tails_ticket 6284]].
