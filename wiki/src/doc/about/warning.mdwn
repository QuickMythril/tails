[[!meta title="Warnings and limitations"]]

Even though we do our best to offer you good tools to protect your
privacy while using a computer, **there is no magic or perfect solution to such
a complex problem**. Understanding well the limits of such tools is a crucial
step to, first, decide whether Tails is the right tool for you, and second,
make a good use of it.

<h1 id="passwords">Tails doesn't make your crappy passwords stronger</h1>

Tor allows you to be anonymous online; Tails allows you to leave no trace on the
computer you're using. But again, **neither or both are magic spells for computer
security**.

If you use weak passwords, they can be guessed by brute-force attacks with or
without Tails in the same way. To know if your passwords are weak and learn good
practices to create better password, you can read [[!wikipedia
Weak_password#Examples_of_weak_passwords desc="Wikipedia: Weak Passwords"]].

<h1 id="wip">Tails is a work in progress</h1>

Tails, as well as all the software it includes, are continuously being developed
and may contain programming errors or security holes.
