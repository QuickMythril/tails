[[!meta title="Can I trust Tails?"]]

For Tails to work for you, you have to know whether you can trust it and us, its developers.
We do not and we would never try to harm to you or our other users,
as a core principle of [[our social contract|about/social_contract]].
As part of that commitment, however, we've written this page to help you make an informed decision
about whether you should trust our software.

In short, we think that the scrutiny of the free software community and
the reputation of the other software we rely on makes Tails a trustworthy project.
We encourage you to do your own research into Tails, our affiliations, and who uses Tails,
before trusting us.

Free software and public scrutiny
=================================

The free software community has a long tradition of publicly reporting
serious issues found within free software. Thanks to public scrutiny,
anyone can have a degree of trust in free software, as long as it is
popular enough that other developers test its source code.

We have designed Tails and [[its license|about/license]] to allow users to
examine our software distribution and see how it functions,
since our source code is available to everyone. That way, users can determine
whether the Tails images that you can download from us
are actually built with our published source code or if any malicious
changes have been made.

Trusting Tails
==============

Tails is the union of Debian and Tor. What we do,
essentially, is gluing it all together: Tails mainly consists of a specification
for which Debian software packages to install and how they should be configured.
If you trust Debian and Tor, all that is left is whether you trust our "glue".
While Tails doesn't
get the same amount of attention as Debian or Tor, we do have eyes on us,
especially from the Tor community and the general security community
(see our [[audits page|security/audits]]).
Our [[specification and design document|contribute/design]] is a good starting
point for understanding how Tails works, and our [[warnings|doc/about/warnings]]
explain what Tails can't protect you from.

Tails anonymity is based on Tor, which is developed by [[The Tor
Project|https://www.torproject.org/]]. [[We trust The Tor Project|doc/about/tor]].
Tor is under a lot of public scrutiny by both academics (research on attacks and
defenses on onion routing) and engineers (The Tor code has gone
through several external audits, and many independent developers also
read through its source code). Security issues have been reported,
but nothing malicious like a backdoorâ€”we think that only conspiracy theorists speculate
about deliberate backdoors in Tor these days. Tor's
distributed trust model also makes it hard for a single entity to capture
an individual's traffic and effectively identify them.

The majority of the software shipped in Tails comes from the
[[Debian GNU/Linux distribution|https://www.debian.org/]]. We also deviate Tails as little
as possible from Debian and [[we've documented that relationship|contribute/relationship_with_upstream/]].
Debian is one of the largest Linux distros, so countless people use Debian's software
packages and countless developers inspect their integrity.
Serious security issues have been discovered (like the infamous
[[Debian SSH PRNG vulnerability|https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html]]),
but backdoors or other intentionally placed security holes
have never been found, to our knowledge.
