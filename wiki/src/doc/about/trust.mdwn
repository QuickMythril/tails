[[!meta title="Can I trust Tails?"]]

For Tails to work for you, you have to know whether you can trust it and us, its developers.
We do not and we would never try to harm to you or our other users,
as a core principle of [[our social contract|about/social_contract]].
We've written this page, however, to help you make an informed decision
about whether you should trust our software.

Free software and public scrutiny
=================================

Free software, [[like Tails|about/license]], allows users to
examine a software distribution and see how it functions,
since the source code must be made available to everyone.
A thorough audit of source code can reveal if any malicious code, like a backdoor,
is present. That way, users can determine whether the Tails images that you can download from us
are actually built with our published source code or if any malicious
changes have been made.

There is a strong tradition within the free software community to publicly report
serious issues that are found within software. Of course, most people do not
have the knowledge, skills or time required to do this. But thanks to public scrutiny,
anyone can have a degree of trust in free software, as long as it is
popular enough that other developers test its source code.

Trusting Tails
==============

Tails is the union of Debian and Tor. What we do,
essentially, is gluing it all together: Tails mainly consists of a specification
for which Debian software packages to install and how they should be configured.
If you trust Debian and Tor, all that is left is whether you trust our "glue".

While Tails doesn't
get the same amount of attention as Debian or Tor, we do have eyes on us,
especially from the Tor community and the general security community
(see our [[audits page|security/audits]]).
Our [[specification and design document|contribute/design]] is a good starting
point for understanding how Tails works.

Trusting Tor
============

Tails anonymity is based on Tor, which is developed by [[The Tor
Project|https://www.torproject.org/]]. Tor is under
a lot of public scrutiny by both academics (research on attacks and
defenses on onion routing) and engineers (The Tor code has gone
through several external audits, and many independent developers also
read through its source code). Security issues have been reported,
but nothing malicious like a backdoorâ€”we think that only conspiracy theorists speculate
about deliberate backdoors in Tor these days. Tor's
distributed trust model also makes it hard for a single entity to capture
an individual's traffic and effectively identify them.

Trusting Debian GNU/Linux
=========================

The majority of [[all software shipped in Tails|doc/about/features]] comes from the
[[Debian GNU/Linux distribution|https://www.debian.org/]].
Debian is one of the largest Linux distros, so countless people use Debian's software
packages and countless developers inspect their integrity.
Serious security issues have been discovered (like the infamous
[[Debian SSH PRNG vulnerability|https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html]]),
but backdoors or other intentionally placed security holes
have never been found, to our knowledge.
