[[!meta title="Can I trust Tails?"]]

For Tails to work for you, you have to know whether you can trust it and us, its developers.
We do not and we would never try to harm to you or our other users,
as a core principle of [[our social contract|about/social_contract]].
As part of that commitment, however, we've written this page to help you make an informed decision
about whether you should trust our software.

In short, we think that the scrutiny of the free software community and
the reputation of the other software we rely on makes Tails a trustworthy project.
We encourage you to do your own research into Tails, our affiliations, and who uses Tails,
before trusting us.

Free software supports public scrutiny
======================================

Based on [[our license|about/license]], we release Tails as free software.
The free software community has a long tradition of publicly reporting
serious issues found within free software. Thanks to public scrutiny,
anyone can have a degree of trust in free software, as long as it is
popular enough that other developers test its source code.

We make the Tails source code available to everyone so users can
examine our software distribution and see how it functions.
That way, users can determine whether the Tails images that you can download from us
are actually built with our published source code or if any malicious
changes have been made. [[Our list of sponsors|sponsors]] can give you an idea of
who supports and reviews Tails software, and [[our user interviews|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/]].
can tell you what kind of people use Tails and what they like and dislike about our software.

Tails uses reputable software
=============================

Tails is the union of Debian and Tor. What we do is essentially gluing the two together:
Tails code mainly specifies which Debian software packages to install and how to configure them.
If you trust Debian and Tor, all that is left is whether you trust our "glue".
Our [[ specification and design document|contribute/design]] explains exactly how Tails works,
and our [[warnings|doc/about/warnings]] explain what Tails can't protect you from.
While Tails doesn't get the same attention as Debian or Tor, we do have eyes on us,
especially from the Tor community and the general security community
(see our [[audits page|security/audits]]).

Tails anonymity is based on Tor, which is developed by [[The Tor
Project|https://www.torproject.org/]]. [[We trust The Tor Project|doc/about/tor]].
Tor is under a lot of scrutiny by both academics (research on attacks and
defenses on onion routing) and engineers (The Tor code has gone
through several external audits, and many independent developers
read through its source code). Security issues have been reported,
but nothing malicious like a backdoorâ€”we think that only conspiracy theorists speculate
about deliberate backdoors in Tor these days. Tor's
distributed trust model also makes it hard for a single entity to capture
an individual's traffic and effectively identify them.

The majority of the software shipped in Tails comes from the
[[Debian GNU/Linux distribution|https://www.debian.org/]]. We deviate Tails as little
as possible from Debian and [[we've documented when we do|contribute/relationship_with_upstream/]].
Debian is one of the largest Linux distros, so countless people use Debian's software
packages and countless developers inspect their integrity.
Serious security issues have been discovered (like the infamous
[[Debian SSH PRNG vulnerability|https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html]]),
but backdoors or other intentionally placed security holes
have never been found, to our knowledge.
