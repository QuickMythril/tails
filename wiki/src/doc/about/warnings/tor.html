</div>

<h2 id="fingerprint">Tails makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably Tails</h2>

<p>Tor and Tails don't protect you by making you look like any random Internet
user, but by making all Tor and Tails users look the same. Then, it becomes
impossible to know who is who among them.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Your Internet service provider (ISP) or local network can
see when you connect to the Tor network. They still cannot know what sites you visit.
To hide that you connect to Tor, you can use [[Tor bridges|first_steps/welcome_screen/bridge_mode]].</p></li>

<li><p>The sites that you visit can know that you are using Tor, because the
<a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html">list of exit
nodes of the Tor network</a> is public.</p></li>

</ul>

<div class="attack">

<p>Parental controls, Internet service providers, and countries
such as China and Iran can identify and block connections to the Tor
network that don't use Tor bridges.</p>

</div>

<div class="attack">

<p>Many websites ask you to solve a CAPTCHA or block access from the Tor
network.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="exit_node">Tor exit traffic can be eavesdropped</h2>

<p>Tor hides your location from destination servers, but it does not encrypt
<i>all</i> your communication. The last relay on a Tor circuit, called the exit node,
establishes the actual connection to destination servers and that last step could be unsecure.</p>

[[!img htw2-tails.png link=no alt="A Tor connection usually goes through 3 relays with the last one establishing the actual connection to the final destination"]]

<p>The exit node can:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Observe your traffic. That is why <i>Tor Browser</i> and Tails include tools,
like [[<i>HTTPS Everywhere</i>|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#https-everywhere]], to
encrypt as much as possible the connection between the exit node and the
destination server.</p></li>

<li><p>Pretend to be the destination server, a technique known as
<i>machine-in-the-middle attack</i> (MitM). That is why you should pay even
more attention to the security warnings in <i>Tor Browser</i>. If you get such
a warning, try to disconnect and reconnect from your local network to restart
Tor and use a different exit node.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>To learn more about what information is available to someone observing the different
parts of a Tor circuit, see the interactive infography at
<a href="https://support.torproject.org/https/https-1/">Tor FAQ: Can exit nodes
eavesdrop on communications?</a>.</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>Tor exit nodes have been used in the past to collect sensitive
information from unencrypted connections. Malicious exit nodes are regularly identified and removed from the Tor network. For an example, see
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/09/security-expert-used-tor-to-collect-government-e-mail-passwords/">Ars

passwords</a>.</p>

<h2 id="correlation">Adversaries watching both Tor entrance and exit nodes might be able to identify users</h2>

<p>A powerful adversary, who could analyze the timing and shape of the traffic
entering and exiting the Tor network, might be able to deanonymize Tor users.
These attacks are called <i>end-to-end correlation attacks</i>, because the attacker
has to observe both ends of a Tor circuit at the same time.</p>

<p>No anonymity network that can be used for rapid connections, like browsing
the web or instant messaging, can protect 100% from end-to-end correlation
attacks, especially not VPNs.</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>End-to-end correlation attacks have been studied in research papers,
but we don't know of any actual use to deanonymize Tor users.</p>
