<h2 id="metadata">Clean metadata from files before sharing them</h2>

<p>Many file formats contain hidden data, or metadata:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>JPEG and other image files often contain information about
where a picture was taken and information about the
device used to take the picture.</p></li>

<li><p>Files created by word processing software often contain information
about the author of the document, and the date and time the document was
created.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>To help you clean metadata from your files, Tails comes with
<a href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2">MAT2</a>, a metadata removal tool
that supports a wide range of commonly used file formats.</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>Metadata has been used in the past to locate people
from pictures they took. For an example, see
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/12/04/166487197/betrayed-by-metadata-john-mcafee-admits-hes-really-in-guatemala">NPR:
Betrayed by metadata, John McAfee admits he's really in
Guatemala</a>.</p>

<h2 id="identities">Use Tails sessions for only one purpose at a time</h2>

<p>If you use Tails sessions for more than one purpose at a time,
an adversary could correlate a relationship between your
activities.</p>

<p>For example, if you log into different accounts on the same website in a
single Tails session, the website could determine that the accounts
are used by the same person, since the connections are coming from the same
Tor circuit.</p>

performing your different activities. For example, restart Tails between checking
your work email and your whistleblowing email.</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>We are not aware of any such attacks to deanonymize people online who
used Tails for different purposes at a time.</p>

</div>

<p>If you are concerned that the files you have saved in your Persistent
Storage can be used to link your different activities together, you should
consider using a different Tails USB stick for each of your activities.
For example, you can use one Tails USB stick for activism work and one
Tails USB stick for journalism work.</p>
