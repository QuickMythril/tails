<h1 id="compromised_hardware">Tails does not protect against compromised hardware</h1>

If the computer has been compromised by someone having physical access
to it and who installed untrusted pieces of hardware (like a
keylogger), then it might be unsafe to use Tails.

<h1 id="untrusted_system">Tails can be compromised if installed or plugged in untrusted systems</h1>

When starting your computer on Tails, it cannot be compromised by a virus in your usual operating
system, but:

* Tails should be installed from a trusted system. Otherwise it might
  be corrupted during installation.

* Plugging your Tails USB stick in a
  compromised operating system might corrupt your Tails installation,
  and destroy the protection that Tails provides. Only use your
  Tails USB stick to start Tails.

See the [[corresponding FAQ|support/faq#compromised-system]].

<h1 id="bios">Tails does not protect against BIOS or firmware attacks</h1>

It is also impossible for Tails to protect against attacks made through
the BIOS or other firmware embedded in the computer. These are
not managed or provided by the operating system directly, and no operating system can protect against
such attacks.

See for example, this [attack on BIOS by
LegbaCore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNYsfUNegEA).
