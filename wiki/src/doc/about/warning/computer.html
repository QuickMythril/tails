<h1 class="embedded">Reducing the risk of running Tails on untrusted computers</h1>

<h2 id="untrusted_system">Install Tails from a computer you trust</h2>

<p>Tails protects you from viruses and malware on your usual
operating system. This is because Tails runs independently from other operating systems.</p>

<p>If you install Tails from a compromised operating system, your
Tails might be corrupted. To reduce that risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always install Tails from a trusted operating system.
  For example, download Tails on a computer with no viruses or clone Tails
  from a trusted friend.</li>
  <li>Use your Tails USB stick only for running Tails.</li>
  <li>Do not use your Tails USB stick to transfer files to or from another operating system.</li>
  <li>Do not leave your Tails USB plugged in while starting another operating
  system on your computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you worry that your Tails might be corrupted, do a [[manual
upgrade|upgrade]] from a trusted operating system.</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>We don't know of any virus able to infect a Tails
installation, but one could be created in the future.</p>

</div>

<h2>No operating system can protect against hardware alterations</h2>

<p>Your computer might be compromised if its physical components have been altered.
For example, if a keylogger has been physically installed on your computer,
your passwords, personal information, and other data typed on your keyboard could
be stored and accessed by someone else, even if you’re using Tails.</p>

<p>Always keep your personal computer in a safe location. Hardware alteration is more likely on public computers
(like those in internet cafés or libraries) and desktop computers, where a device is easier to hide.</p>

<p>If you worry that the computer that you use for Tails might be modified:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a [[password manager|doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords]] to
  paste saved passwords. That way, you don't have to type passwords that might
  be visible to people or cameras near you.</li>
  <li>Use the [[Screen Keyboard|doc/encryption_and_privacy/virtual_keyboard]] in Tails,
  if you are using a public computer or worry that your computer might be
  compromised with a keylogger.</li>
</ul>

<div class="attack">

<ul>
<li>Keyloggers are easy to buy and use on desktop computers but not on
laptops. For an example, see
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJo8qCYE8M">KeeLog: KeyGrabber
forensic keylogger getting started</a>.</li>
<li>Other hardware alterations are much more complicated and expensive
to perform. For an example, see
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/">Ars

implant</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bios">No operating system can protect against BIOS and firmware attacks</h2>

<p>Firmware includes the BIOS or UEFI and other code stored in electronic chips on the computer.
All operating systems, including Tails, depend on firmware to start and run, so no operating system
can protect you from a firmware attack. Like a car depends on the quality of the road it is driving on.</p>

<p>Keeping your computer physically secure can protect against some firmware
attacks, but some other firmware attacks can be performed remotely.</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>Firmware attacks have been demonstrated, but are complicated and
expensive to perform. We don't know of any actual use against Tails
users. For an example, see
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNYsfUNegEA>LegbaCore: Stealing
GPG keys/emails in Tails via remote firmware infection</a>.</p>
