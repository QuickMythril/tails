<h1 id="compromised_hardware">Tails does not protect against compromised hardware</h1>

<p>If the computer has been compromised by someone having physical access
to it and who installed untrusted pieces of hardware (like a
keylogger), then it might be unsafe to use Tails.</p>

<h2 id="untrusted_system">Software viruses and malware</h2>
<p>Tails is protected from viruses and malware that might be on your usual
operating system. This is because Tails runs independently from your usual
operating system.</p>
 
<p>However, if you install Tails from a compromised operating system, then your
Tails might be corrupted.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always install Tails with a trusted operating system.
  For example, download Tails on an
  uncompromised computer with no viruses or malware, or clone a Tails
  installation from a trusted friend.</li>
  <li> Use your Tails USB stick only for running Tails. Do not use it to transfer
  files to or from other operating systems. Do not leave your Tails USB plugged in while
  another operating system is started on your computer. Plugging your Tails USB
  stick into a compromised operating system might corrupt your Tails
  installation, and destroy the protection that Tails provides.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hardware alterations</h2> 
<p>Your computer might be compromised if its physical components have been altered by 
someone you don't trust. If a keylogger has been physically installed on
your computer, for example, your passwords, personal information, and other
data typed on your keyboard can be stored and accessed by someone else, even
if you’re using Tails. For example, see this 
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJo8qCYE8M>demonstration of a USB keylogger</a>.</p>  

<ul>
  <li>The best protection against hardware alteration is to keep your personal computer
  in a safe location. Hardware alteration is more likely on public computers
  (in internet cafes, libraries, etc) and desktop computers, where a device is easier to hide.</li>
  <li>If you are using a public computer or worry that your computer might have been
  compromised with a keylogger, you can use the 
  [[Screen Keyboard|doc/encryption_and_privacy/virtual_keyboard]] in Tails.
  As screen keyboards might be visible to other people or cameras, you can also
  avoid typing passwords on a compromised computer by using a 
  [[password manager|doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords]], which
  allows you to paste saved passwords into fields instead of typing them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bios">BIOS or firmware attacks</h2>
<p>Firmware is basic software that controls specific hardware.
Firmware includes the BIOS and UEFI, which activate hardware during
your computer’s start up (boot) process. Because operating systems (like Tails)
operate on top of your computer’s firmware, Tails cannot protect you from a firmware hack.</p>

<p>Because firmware can be altered physically or remotely,
keeping your computer physically secure can only protect against some firmware hacks.
Firmware hacks, however, affect specific, vulnerable firmware and are more complex
and resource-intensive, which makes them a less likely, though still possible, threat.
For a specific example, see <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNYsfUNegEA>this attack on BIOS by Legbacore</a>.</p>
