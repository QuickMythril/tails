<h1 class="embedded">Reducing the risk of running Tails on untrusted computers</h1>

<div class="standalone">

<p>Tails can safely run on a computer that has a virus. However:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing Tails from an infected computer might corrupt your Tails installation</li>
  <li>Running Tails on a computer with a compromised BIOS or firmware, or with unsafe hardware, like keyloggers, can make Tails unsafe to use</li>
</ul>

<p>These risks are more likely if you are using Tails on a shared computer.</p>

</div>

<p>Tails is safer than most operating systems. There are steps you can take,
however, to use Tails more safely.</p>

<h2 id="untrusted_system">Software viruses</h2>
<p>Tails is protected from any viruses or malware on your usual
operating system, because Tails runs independently from it.</p>

<p>If you install Tails from a compromised operating system, however, your
Tails might be corrupted (although we don't know any cases of this attack
being used.). To reduce that risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always install Tails with a trusted operating system.
  For example, download Tails on an
  uncompromised computer with no viruses or clone Tails
  from a trusted friend.</li>
  <li>Use your Tails USB stick only for running Tails. Do not use it to transfer
  files to or from other operating systems. Do not leave your Tails USB plugged in while
  another operating system is started on your computer. Similarly, if you plug your Tails
  USB stick in while another, compromised operating system is running, it might
  corrupt your Tails.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hardware alterations</h2>
<p>Your computer might be compromised if its physical components have been altered.
For example, if a keylogger has been physically installed on your computer,
your passwords, personal information, and other data typed on your keyboard can
be stored and accessed by someone else, even if you’re using Tails. See this
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJo8qCYE8M>demonstration of a USB keylogger</a>.</p>
<p>If you are worried that the computer you use might be modified, you can take these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The best protection against hardware alteration is to keep your personal computer
  in a safe location. Hardware alteration is more likely on public computers
  (in internet cafes, libraries, etc) and desktop computers, where a device is easier to hide.</li>
  <li>If you are using a public computer or worry that your computer might have been
  compromised with a keylogger, you can use the
  [[Screen Keyboard|doc/encryption_and_privacy/virtual_keyboard]] in Tails.
  You can also use a [[password manager|doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords]],
  which allows you to paste saved passwords into fields, to avoid typing
  passwords that might be visible to other people or cameras near you.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bios">BIOS and firmware attacks</h2>
<p>Firmware includes the BIOS and UEFI, which activate hardware during
your computer’s start up process. Because operating systems (like Tails)
operate on top of your computer’s firmware, Tails cannot protect you from a firmware hack.</p>

<p>Keeping your computer physically secure can only protect against some firmware
hacks, because firmware can be altered physically or remotely. Firmware hacks,
however, are complex and resource-intensive, so they are a rare,
although still possible, threat. For a specific example, see
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNYsfUNegEA>this attack on BIOS</a> by
Legbacore. (We don't know of any cases where this attack has actually been used.)</p>
