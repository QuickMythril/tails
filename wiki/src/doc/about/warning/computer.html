[[!meta title="Using untrusted computers"]]

<h1 id="compromised_hardware">Untrusted computers</h1>
<p class="standalone">Tails can safely run on a computer that has a virus. However:
<ul>
  <li>Installing Tails from an infected computer might corrupt your Tails installation</li>
  <li>Running Tails on a computer with a compromised BIOS or firmware, or with unsafe hardware, like keyloggers, can make Tails unsafe to use</li>
</ul>
These risks are more likely if you are using Tails on a shared computer.</p>

<p>Tails is safer than most operating systems. There are steps you can take,
however, to use Tails more safely.

<h2 id="untrusted_system">Install Tails from a computer you trust</h2>
<p>Tails protects you from any viruses and malware on your usual
operating system. This is because Tails runs independently from your usual
operating system.</p>

<p>If you install Tails from a compromised operating system, however, your
Tails might be corrupted. (We don't know any cases of this attack
being used.) To reduce that risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always install Tails from a trusted operating system.
  For example, download Tails on a compromised computer with no viruses or clone Tails
  from a trusted friend.</li>
  <li>Use your Tails USB stick only for running Tails.
  <li>Do not use your Tails USB stick to transfer files to or from another operating system.
  <li>Do not leave your Tails USB plugged in while starting another operating
  system on your computer.</li>
  <li>If you plug your Tails USB stick in while a compromised operating
  system is running, your Tails might become corrupted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>No operating system can protect against hardware alterations</h2>
<p>Your computer might be compromised if its physical components have been altered.
For example, if a keylogger has been physically installed on your computer,
your passwords, personal information, and other data typed on your keyboard can
be stored and accessed by someone else, even if you’re using Tails. See this
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJo8qCYE8M>demonstration of a USB keylogger</a>.</p>
<p>You can take these steps, if you worry that the computer that you use might be modified:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep your personal computer in a safe location. Hardware alteration is more likely on public computers
  (in internet cafés, libraries, etc) and desktop computers, where a device is easier to hide.</li>
  <li>Use a [[password manager|doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords]] to
  paste saved passwords. That way, you don't have to type passwords that might
  be visible to people or cameras near you.</li>
  <li>Use the [[Screen Keyboard|doc/encryption_and_privacy/virtual_keyboard]] in Tails,
  if you are using a public computer or worry that your computer might be
  compromised with a keylogger.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bios">No operating system can protect against BIOS and firmware attacks</h2>
<p>Firmware includes the BIOS and UEFI, which activate hardware when your computer
starts up. Operating systems (like Tails) depend on firmware, so they
cannot protect you from a firmware hack.</p>

<p>Keeping your computer physically secure can only protect against some firmware
attacks, because firmware can be altered physically or remotely. Firmware hacks
are complex and resource-intensive, so they are a rare, although still possible,
threat. For a specific example, see
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNYsfUNegEA>this attack on BIOS</a> by
Legbacore. (We don't know of any cases where this attack has actually been used.)</p>
