<h1 class="embedded">Tor and its limitations</h1>

</div>

<h2 id="fingerprint">Tails makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably Tails</h2>

<p>Using Tails doesn't make you look like any random Internet user. Every time you
connect to the Internet in Tails, you use the Tor network.</p>

<p>Your Internet service provider (ISP) or local network administrator can
see when you connect to the Tor network. They still won't know what sites you visit.
To hide your Tor connection from your ISP, you can use [[Tor bridges|first_steps/welcome_screen/bridge_mode]].</p>

<p>Any destination server you contact through Tor can also check whether
you are using a Tor connection by consulting public lists of exit nodes,
such as the <a href="https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist">Bulk Exit List tool</a>
provided by the Tor Project. See also [[Can I hide the fact that I am using Tails?|fingerprint]]</p>

<div class="attack">

<ul>
<li>Parental controls, Internet service providers, and countries
such as China and Iran can identify and block connections to the Tor
network that don't use Tor bridges.</li>
<li>Many websites ask you to solve a CAPTCHA or block access from the Tor
network.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 id="exit_node">Tor exit traffic can be eavesdropped</h2>

<p>Tor hides your location from destination servers, but it does not encrypt
<i>all</i> your communication. The last relay on a Tor circuit, called the exit node,
establishes the actual connection to destination servers and that last step could be unsecure.</p>

[[!img htw2-tails.png link=no alt="A Tor connection usually goes through 3 relays with the last one establishing the actual connection to the final destination"]]

<p>Tor cannot encrypt your connection from the exit node to the destination server,
so the exit node itself could capture your traffic. See
<a href="https://support.torproject.org/https/https-1/">Tor FAQ: Can exit nodes
eavesdrop on communications?</a>. When your traffic leaves the Tor exit node,
it could also be intercepted. The intercepter could then pretend to be the valid
destination server, a technique known as a "man-in-the-middle" (MitM) attack.</p>

<p>To protect yourself against such attacks, take extra care to verify server authenticity.
Usually, this is done automatically when your browser checks each site's SSL certificates
against a recognized [[!wikipedia Certificate_authority desc="certificate authority"]].
If you get a security exception message such as the one in the image below,
you might be the victim of a man-in-the-middle attack. Don't bypass the warning.

<p>For additional protection, you should also use end-to-end encryption tools.
Tails includes [[tools so you can use end-to-end encryption while browsing,
sending email, or chatting|features#index3h2]].</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>Tor exit nodes have been used in the past to collect sensitive
information from unencrypted connections. For an example, see
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/09/security-expert-used-tor-to-collect-government-e-mail-passwords/">Ars
Technica: Security expert used Tor to collect government e-mail
passwords</a>.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="correlation">Adversaries watching both Tor entrance and exit nodes might be able to identify users</h2>

<p>Because Tor uses fast server connections, a determined attacker could
examine the timing and shape of traffic entering and exiting the Tor network to identify Tor users.
These attacks are called "end-to-end correlation attacks", because an attacker
has to observe both ends of a Tor circuit at the same time.</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>End-to-end correlation attacks have been studied in research papers,
but we don't know of any actual use to deanonymize Tor users.</p>
