[[!meta title="Tails relies on Tor"]]

<p class="standalone">Tails uses the Tor network because it is the strongest and most popular
network to protect from surveillance and censorship. But Tor has some limitations if you are concerned about:
<ul>
<li>Hiding the fact that you are using Tor and Tails.</li>
<li>The confidentiality of your online communications.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1 id="fingerprint">Tails makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably Tails</h1>

<p>Using Tails doesn't make you look like any random Internet user.
Tor and Tails provide anonymity by making all of their users look the same
so it's not possible to identify who is who amongst them.</p>

<p>When you use Tails, your internet service provider (ISP) or your local network administrator
will be able to see that you're connecting to a Tor relay, and not a normal web server;
Tor network connections look different to them. The destination server you are contacting through Tor can also know whether your
communication comes from a Tor exit node by consulting publicly
available lists of exit nodes, such as the Tor Project's
<a href="https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist">Bulk Exit List tool</a></p>

<p> You can use [[Tor bridges|first_steps/welcome_screen/bridge_mode]]
to hide the fact that you are using Tor. See also [[Can I hide the fact that I am using Tails?|fingerprint]]</p>

<h1 id="exit_node">Tor exit nodes can eavesdrop</h1>

<p>Tor hides your location from destination servers, but it does not encrypt
<i>all</i> your communication.</p>

<p>Instead of taking a direct route from source to destination, Tor network connections
take a random pathway through several Tor relays to cover your tracks.
No observer at any single point can tell where the data came from or where it's going.</p>

[[!img htw2-tails.png link=no alt="A Tor connection usually goes through 3 relays with the last one establishing the actual connection to the final destination"]]

<p>The last relay on this circuit, called the exit node, establishes the actual
connection to destination servers. Tor does not and cannot encrypt your connection
from the exit node to the destination server, so any exit node could capture the traffic
passing through it. See <a href="https://support.torproject.org/https/https-1/">Tor FAQ: Can exit nodes eavesdrop on
communications?</a>.</p>

<p>To protect yourself against such attacks you should use end-to-end encryption.
Tails includes tools so you can use strong encryption while
browsing, sending email or chatting, as presented on our [[about
page|/about#cryptography]].</p>

<h1 id="man-in-the-middle">Tor exit node traffic can be intercepted</h1>

[[!img man-in-the-middle.png link=no alt=""]]
<!-- Source: wiki/lib/man-in-the-middle.svg -->

<p>When your Internet traffic is on its way from the Tor exit node to the destination node,
it could be intercepted. The intercepter could then pretend to be the valid
destination server, an technique known as a "man-in-the-middle attack" (MitM).</p>

<p>To protect yourself from such attacks, you should use end-to-end
encryption tools and take extra care to verify server authenticity. Usually,
this is automatically done by your browser checking each site's SSL certificates
against a recognized [[!wikipedia Certificate_authority desc="certificate authority"]]).
If you get a security exception message such as the one in the image below,
you might be the victim of a man-in-the-middle attack. Don't bypass the warning
unless you have another way to check the certificate's fingerprint.</p>

[[!img ssl_warning.png link=no alt="This Connection is Untrusted"]]

<p>In general, Tor makes it more difficult for MitM attacks to target a
specific person with only the blessing of a rogue SSL certificate. However, Tor
makes it easier for people or organizations running exit nodes to perform large-scale MitM attempts, or
attacks targeted at a specific server, and especially against Tor users.</p>

<h1 id="correlation">Adversaries watching both Tor entrance and exit nodes might be able to deanonymize users</h1>

<p>Because Tor uses low-latency communications, it's possible that an attacker could
examine the traffic entering and exiting the Tor network to deanonymize Tor users.
Such attacks are called <i>end-to-end correlation attacks</i>, because they
require observing both ends of a Tor circuit at the same time.</p>

<p>End-to-end correlation attacks have been studied in research papers
but we are not aware of any actual use to deanonymize Tor users. In the past,
law enforcement agencies have preferred exploiting software vulnerabilities
in <i>Tor Browser</i> and Tails to deanonymize users, instead of
performing end-to-end correlation attacks.</p>
