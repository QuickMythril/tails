[[!meta title="Tails relies on Tor"]]

<p class="standalone">Tails uses the Tor network because it is the strongest and most popular
network to protect from surveillance and censorship. But Tor has some limitations if you are concerned about:
<ul>
<li>Hiding the fact that you are using Tor and Tails.</li>
<li>The confidentiality of your online communications.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1 id="fingerprint">Tails makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably Tails</h1>

<p>Using Tails doesn't make you look like any random Internet user.
Tor and Tails provide anonymity by making all of their users look the same
so it is not possible to identify who is who among them.</p>

<p>When you use Tails, your Internet service provider or your local network administrator
can see that you're connecting to Tor. The destination server you contact through
Tor can also know whether your communication comes from a Tor exit node by
consulting publicly available lists of exit nodes, such as the
<a href="https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist">Bulk Exit List tool</a>
provided by the Tor Project.</p>

<p> You can use [[Tor bridges|first_steps/welcome_screen/bridge_mode]]
for additional anonymity. See also [[Can I hide the fact that I am using Tails?|fingerprint]]</p>

<h1 id="exit_node">Tor exit traffic can be eavesdropped</h1>

<p>Tor hides your location from destination servers, but it does not encrypt
<i>all</i> your communication. The last relay on a Tor circuit, called the exit node, establishes the actual
connection to destination servers.</p>

[[!img htw2-tails.png link=no alt="A Tor connection usually goes through 3 relays with the last one establishing the actual connection to the final destination"]]

<p>Tor cannot encrypt your connection from the exit node to the destination server,
so an exit node could capture your traffic. See
<a href="https://support.torproject.org/https/https-1/">Tor FAQ: Can exit nodes
eavesdrop on communications?</a>. It is also possible that when Internet traffic
is on its way from the Tor exit node, it could be intercepted. The intercepter
could then pretend to be the valid destination server, a technique known as a
"man-in-the-middle" (MitM) attack.</p>

<p>To protect yourself against such attacks, take extra care to verify server authenticity.
Usually, this is done automatically when your browser checks each site's SSL certificates
against a recognized [[!wikipedia Certificate_authority desc="certificate authority"]].
If you get a security exception message such as the one in the image below,
you might be the victim of a man-in-the-middle attack. Don't bypass the warning.
</p>

<p>For additional protection, you should also use end-to-end encryption tools.
Tails includes [[tools so you can use end-to-end encryption while browsing,
sending email, or chatting|features#index3h2]].

<h1 id="correlation">Adversaries watching both Tor entrance and exit nodes might be able to identify users</h1>

<p>Because Tor uses fast server connections, a determined attacker could
examine the timing and shape of traffic entering and exiting the Tor network to deanonymize Tor users.
Such attacks are called <i>end-to-end correlation attacks</i>, because they
require observing both ends of a Tor circuit at the same time.</p>

<p>End-to-end correlation attacks have been studied in research papers,
but we are not aware of any actual use to deanonymize Tor users. Law enforcement
agencies usually exploit software vulnerabilities
in <i>Tor Browser</i> and Tails to deanonymize users, instead of
performing end-to-end correlation attacks.</p>
