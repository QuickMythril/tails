<p>Tails can safely run on a computer that has a virus, but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing Tails from an infected computer might corrupt your Tails installation</li>
  <li>Running Tails on a computer with a compromised BIOS or firmware, or with
      unsafe hardware, can make Tails unsafe to use</li>
</ul>
