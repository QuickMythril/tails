[[!meta title="⚠ Identity ⚠"]]

<p>Tails alone cannot protect your identity in all cases. It is important that
you also take steps to protect your identity.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of examples of what you can do to protect your
identity:</p>

<h2 id="metadata">Clean metadata from files before sharing them</h2>

<p>Many file formats contain hidden data, or metadata:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Files created by word processing software often contain information
  about the author of the document, and the date and time the document was
  created.</li>
  <li>JPEG and other image files often contain information about when and
  where a picture was taken, along with information about the manufacturer and model of the
  device used to take the picture.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help you clean metadata from your files, Tails comes with
<a href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2">MAT2</a>, a metadata removal tool
that supports a wide range of commonly used file formats.</p>

<h2 id="identities">Use Tails sessions for only one purpose at a time</h2>

<p>If you use Tails sessions for more than one purpose at a time,
an adversary could correlate a relationship between your
activities.</p>

<p>For example, if you log into different accounts on the same website in a
single Tails session, the website could determine that the accounts
are used by the same person, since the connections are coming from the same
Tor circuit.</p>

<p>To help prevent an adversary from correlating a relationship between the
activities you perform while using Tails, you can reboot Tails between
performing your different activities.</p>

<p>If you are concerned that the files you have saved in your Persistent
Storage can be used to link your different activities together, you should
consider using a different Tails USB stick for each of your activities.</p>
