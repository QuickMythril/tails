[[!meta title="⚠ Identity ⚠"]]

<p>Tails alone cannot protect your identity in all cases. It is important that
you also take steps to help protect your identity.</p>

<p>It is impossible to list everything that you can do to help protect your
identity. But, here are some examples of what you can do:</p>

<h2 id="metadata">Clean metadata from files before sharing them</h2>

<p>Many file formats contain hidden data, or metadata. Files created by word
processing software often contains information about the author of the
document, and the date and time the document was created. JPEG and other image
files often contain information about when and where a picture was taken,
along with the manufacturer and model of the device used to take the
picture.</p>

<p>To help you clean metadata from your files, Tails comes with
<a href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2">MAT2</a>, a metadata removal tool
that supports a wide range of commonly used file formats.</p>

<h2 id="identities">Use Tails sessions for only one purpose at a time</h2>

<p>If you use Tails sessions for more than one purpose at a time, it is
possible that an adversary could correlate a relationship between your
activities.</p>

<p>For example, if you log into different accounts on the same website in a
single Tails session, the website could possibly determine that the accounts
are used by the same person, since the connections are coming from the same
Tor circuit.</p>

<p>To help prevent an adversary from correlating a relationship between the
activities you perform while using Tails, you can reboot Tails in between
performing your different activities.</p>

<p>If you are concerned that the files you have saved in your Persistent
Storage can be used to link your different activities together, you should
consider using a different Tails USB stick for each of your activities.</p>
