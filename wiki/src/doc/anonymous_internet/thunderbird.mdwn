[[!meta title="Emailing and reading news with Thunderbird"]]

Tails includes <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> for:

- Reading and writing emails
- Reading [[!wikipedia RSS]] and [[!wikipedia Atom_(Web_standard) desc="Atom"]] feeds for news and blogs

[[!toc levels=2]]

To start <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Thunderbird</span></span>.

<div class="tip">

<p>To store your
emails, feeds, and settings across different working sessions,
turn on the [[Thunderbird|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#thunderbird]]
feature of the Persistent Storage.</p>

</div>

For more detailed documentation, refer to the [official
<span class="application">Thunderbird</span>
help](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/thunderbird).

<h1 id="account">Configuring an email account</h1>

1. When starting <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> for the first
   time, an assistant appears to guide you through the process of
   configuring <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> to access your
   email account.

   <div class="tip">
   <p>To start this assistant again in the future from the main window of
   <span class="application">Thunderbird</span>, choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class=symbolic link=no]]</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Preferences</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Account Settings</span>
   </span> and then from the <span class="guilabel">Account Settings</span>
   dialog choose <span class="guilabel">Account Actions</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guilabel">Add Mail Account&hellip;</span>.</p>
   </div>

1. Enter your name, email address, and password into the corresponding fields.

1. Click <span class="guilabel">Continue</span>.

1. The assistant tries to configure automatically the correct parameters
   to connect to your email provider based on your email address.

   If the automatic configuration fails, consult your email provider
   about how to configure your email account manually.

1. If the automatic configuration succeeds, you might have to specify
   which protocol to use to connect to your email provider, either
   <span class="guilabel">IMAP</span> or <span class="guilabel">POP</span>.

      - With <span class="guilabel">IMAP</span>,
        <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> constantly synchronizes
        with the server and displays the emails and folders that are
	currently stored on the server. IMAP is better suited if you access
        your emails from different operating systems.

      - With <span class="guilabel">POP</span>,
        <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> downloads the emails that
        are in the inbox on the server and possibly deletes them from the
	server. POP is better suited if you access your emails from Tails only
        and store them in the persistent storage.

   To know more, see also this [comparison between POP and
   IMAP](https://help.riseup.net/en/email/clients/#choose-imap-or-pop) by
   Riseup.

<h1 id="privacy">Enhanced privacy</h1>

<span class="application">Thunderbird</span> in Tails is configured
for additional privacy and anonymity.

For example, <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> in Tails:

- Removes information about the language of your session or spellchecker
  from the headers of the emails that you send.
- Removes information that could identify you as a Tails user, like the
  version of GnuPG or Enigmail, from the headers of the emails that you
  send.
- Only allows secure protocols and disables insecure protocols, like
  SSL3.
- Disables tracking technologies, like cookies and JavaScript, when
  viewing emails or feeds in HTML.

<div class="note">

<p>Emails and feeds in HTML format are displayed in plain text by
default and can become harder to read.</p>

</div>

These enhancements are inherited
from the former
<span class="application">[TorBirdy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy)</span>
extension.
To learn more about the security properties provided by this configuration,
you can read the [<span class="application">TorBirdy</span> design document](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/raw-attachment/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/EMail/Thunderbird/Thunderbird%2BTor.pdf).

<h1 id="language">Using Thunderbird in your language</h1>

To use <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> in your language, you can
install the <span class="command">thunderbird-l10n-<span class="command-placeholder">lang</span></span>
package using the [[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]
feature. Replace <span class="command-placeholder">lang</span> with the code
for your language. For example, <span class="command">es</span> for Spanish or
<span class="command">de</span> for German.

<h1 id="openpgp">OpenPGP encryption</h1>

<div class="note">

<p>
Since Tails 4.13 (November 2020) we install <span class="application">Thunderbird
78</span> which introduces built-in support for OpenPGP encryption,
making <span class="application">Enigmail</span> obsolete. If you
currently use <span class="application">Enigmail</span> in Tails,
consider following our [[migration instructions|openpgp_migration]].
</p>

</div>

<span class="application">Thunderbird's</span> [official HOWTO and
FAQ](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/openpgp-thunderbird-howto-and-faq)
contains a lot of useful information, so consider having a look there
as well!

<h2 id="master-password">Setting up a Master Password (recommended)</h2>

In *Thunderbird*, OpenPGP private keys are not protected by a passphrase.
That's why we recommend that you set up a Master Password.

With a Master Password, your private key is encrypted in your
*Thunderbird* profile and only unlocked while *Thunderbird* is running.
If your *Thunderbird* profile is stored in your Persistent Storage, then
your private key is encrypted twice: once by *Thunderbird* in your
profile and a second time by the encryption of the Persistent Storage.

1. Enter the preferences through
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class=symbolic link=no]]</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Preferences</span></span>.

1. Select <span class="guilabel">Privacy & Security</span> and scroll
   to the <span class="guilabel">Passwords</span> section.

1. Check the <span class="guilabel">Use a master password</span>
   checkbox and follow the on-screen instructions.

<h3>Import your private key in <em>Thunderbird</em></h3>

In *Thunderbird*:

1. Enter
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class=symbolic link=no]]</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Account Settings</span></span>.

1. Under the account you wish to migrate, select <span
   class="guilabel">End-To-End Encryption</span> to open the account's
   OpenPGP settings.

1. Click <span class="button">Add Key…</span>, select <span
   class="guilabel">Import an existing OpenPGP Key</span> and click
   <span class="button">Continue</span>.

1. Click <span class="button">Select File to Import…</span> and open
   the key file you exported in the first step.

1. Make sure your key is listed and that the <span
   class="guilabel">Treat this key as a Personal Key</span> checkbox
   is checked, and follow the on-screen instructions until you are
   back at the <span class="guilabel">End-To-End Encryption</span>
   settings.

1. It should display "OpenPGP Keys imported successfully", and below
   you should see your key listed. By default "None" is selected,
   which means OpenPGP is disabled, but if you click your key to
   select it, your account is ready for OpenPGP!

<h2 id="generate-key">Generating a new OpenPGP key</h2>

<div class="note">

<p>
In case you are a <span class="application">GnuPG</span> user, note
that <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> and <span
class="application">GnuPG</span> uses separate keyrings. Any public
key you want to use in <span class="application">Thunderbird</span>
must be present in its keyring, so if you only have them in <span
class="application">GnuPG</span>, you must export it from <span
class="application">GnuPG</span> and import it in <span
class="application">Thunderbird</span>.
</p>

</div>

1. Enter
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class=symbolic link=no]]</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Account Settings</span></span>.

1. Under the account you wish to generate a key for, select <span
   class="guilabel">End-To-End Encryption</span> to open the account's
   OpenPGP settings.

1. Click <span class="button">Add Key…</span>, select <span
   class="guilabel">Create a new OpenPGP Key</span>, click <span
   class="button">Continue</span> and follow the on-screen
   instructions. This should result in a functioning OpenPGP
   configuration for your account!

1. While you are still at the <span class="guilabel">End-To-End
   Encryption</span> settings you may want look a bit down to
   configure the <span class="guilabel">Default settings for sending
   messages</span> so it suits your preferences, and helps [[avoid
   mistakes|thunderbird#plaintext_mistake]].

<h2 id="encrypting">Encrypting and signing email</h2>

When composing email you can encrypt email by selecting
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Options</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Require Encryption</span></span>.
and sign email by selecting
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Options</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Digitally Sign This Message</span></span>.

When sending encrypting email to a recipient whose public key is not
in <span class="application">Thunderbird's</span> keyring, you will be
given the option to download it from a keyserver. In this case you
will see a window called "OpenPGP Message Security", which will list
each recipient and their key status. For keys with "no key available",
select it and click <span class="button">Manage keys for selected
recipient…</span> which will open a new window. By clicking <span
class="button">Discover new or updated key</span> it will be
downloaded from a keyserver (if present).

Just having the key in the keyring is not enough. Keys must also be
marked as
[accepted](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/openpgp-thunderbird-howto-and-faq#w_what-does-key-acceptance-mean),
otherwise <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> refuses to
encrypt using that key. To accept the key you just fetched, click
<span class="button">Open details and edit acceptance…</span> and
follow the on-screen instructions. In order to "accept" the key, one
of the "Yes" options must be selected.

<h3 id="avoid-mistakes">Avoid sending unencrypted emails by mistake</h3>

By default,
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Options</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Require Encryption</span></span>.
is not checked, so it is dangerously easy to forget it and then end up
unintentionally sending unencrypted email. You can change this
default in the <span class="guilabel">End-To-End Encryption</span>
settings under the <span class="guilabel">Default settings for sending
messages</span> section.
