Connecting to a network
=======================

You can connect to a network using a wired, Wi-Fi, or mobile data
connection:

1. Open the system menu in the top-right corner.

   [[!img doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop/system.png link="no"]]

   - If a wired connection is detected, Tails automatically connects to the network.

   - To connect to a Wi-Fi network, choose <span class="guilabel">Wi-Fi Not
     Connected</span> and then <span class="guilabel">Select Network</span>.

   <div class="bug">

   <p>If there is no option to connect to a Wi-Fi network, your Wi-Fi interface
   is not working in Tails. See our documentation on [[troubleshooting Wi-Fi
   not working|no-wifi]].</p>

   </div>

   - To connect to a mobile data network, choose
     <span class="guilabel">Mobile Broadband</span>.

   <div class="note">
   <p>It is currently impossible to connect to a network using:</p>

   <ul>
   <li>Dial-up modems.</li>
   <li>VPNs, see [[the corresponding FAQ|support/faq#vpn]].</li>
   </ul>

   </div>

1. After establishing a connection to a network, the *Tor Connection* assistant
   appears to help you [[connect to the Tor network|tor]].

For more information, open
<span class="application">[[GNOME Help|first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop#help]]</span>
and choose <span class="guilabel">Networking, web & email</span>.

If you are concerned about being identified as a Tails user on your
network, read our documentation about [[network
fingerprinting|tor/hide]].

Using Tor bridges or a local proxy
==================================

To connect to Tor using bridges or configure a proxy to access the Internet,
you need to [[activate additional Tor configuration when starting Tails|first_steps/welcome_screen#additional]].

Modifying and saving your network settings
==========================================

To modify your network settings, for example, to configure whether or not
to automatically connect to a Wi-Fi network, do the following:

1. Open the system menu in the top-right corner.

1. Click on the [[!img lib/preferences-system.png alt="System" class="symbolic" link="no"]] button to open the system settings.

1. Choose <span class="guilabel">Network</span>.

If you want to reuse your custom
configuration or the passwords of encrypted wireless connections across separate
working sessions, you can turn on the [[Network connections|first_steps/persistence/configure#network_connections]]
feature of the Persistent Storage.
