To sign in to a network using a captive portal:

1. Try visiting any website using the *Unsafe Browser*.

   Choose a website that is common in your location, for example a search
   engine or news site.

1. You should be redirected to the captive portal instead of the
   website.

1. After you signed in to the network, Tor should start.

   <!-- Clarify this after #18382 and #5785. -->

1. After Tor is ready, close the *Unsafe Browser*.

   You can use *Tor Browser* and any other application as usual.
