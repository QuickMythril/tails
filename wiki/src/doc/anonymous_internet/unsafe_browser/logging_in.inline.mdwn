To sign in to a network using a captive portal:

1. Try visiting an innocent-looking website that is common in your
   location, for example a search engine or news site.

   - <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank"/>DuckDuckGo</a>
   - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
   - <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

1. You should be redirected to the captive portal instead of the
   website.

1. After you signed in to the network, Tor should start.

   <!-- Clarify this after #18382 and #5785. -->

1. After Tor is ready, close the *Unsafe Browser*.

   You can use *Tor Browser* and any other application as usual.
