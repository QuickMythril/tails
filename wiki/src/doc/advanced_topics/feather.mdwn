[[!meta title="Exchanging Monero using Feather"]]

[*Feather*](https://featherwallet.org/) is a Monero wallet
with a graphical interface similar to that of
[[*Electrum*|doc/anonymous_internet/electrum]].

To learn how to install and use *Feather* in Tails, see
[this guide](https://xmrguide.org/tails/feather/install).

<div class="caution">

<p>The guide linked to above has you install <i>Feather</i> as an AppImage
instead of using the
[[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]] feature. This is
because <i>Feather</i> is not included in Debian.</p>

<p>Because <i>Feather</i> is not included in Debian, it does not receive the
same [[high level of scrutiny|doc/about/trust/#trust_debian]].

<p>Also, because <i>Feather</i> is not being installed using the Additional
Software feature, it will not be automatically updated.</p>
