[[!meta title="Error while checking for upgrades"]]

Tails could not determine whether an upgrade is available from our website.

This is most likely caused by a network connection problem.

Check your network connection and restart Tails to check for upgrades again.

If the problem persists, you can do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade#manual]].

You can also look at our [[release notes|doc/upgrade/release_notes]] to see if
there are known issues with automatically upgrading to the latest version of
Tails.
