What is metadata?
=================

Metadata is "data about data" or "information about information." It is used
to help describe, identify, categorize, and locate files.

However, metadata can also be used to deanonymize, and also to expose
information meant to be private.

Examples of metadata include:

- In image files:
  - the location where a photo was taken
  - the date and time a photo was taken
  - the model of the camera used to take a photo
- In text document files:
  - the author of the document
  - changes to the document

To learn more about how metadata can be used, see

Remove metadata from files
==========================

Tails includes
<a href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2"><span class="application">mat2</span></a>
to help remove metadata from files.

**mat2** works on many file formats, including:

- image files, such as .jpeg, .png, and .gif
- <span class="application">LibreOffice</span> files, such as .odt and .ods
- Office Open XML (OOXML) files, such as .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx
- audio files, such as .mp3, .flac, and .ogg
- video files, such as .mp4 and .avi
- archive files, such as .zip and .tar

<div class="caution">

<p>It is impossible to reliably find and remove all metadata in complex file
formats.</p>

<p>To help prevent unwanted metadata from being included in your files, you
should configure your devices and software to not save unwanted metadata.</p>

<p>Also, instead of saving files in complex formats, you should save files in
simpler formats whenever possible. For example, instead of saving a text
document as a .docx file, you can save the document as a plain text file.</p>

</div>

To use <span class="application">mat2</span> to remove metadata from your
files:

1. Open the <span class="application">Files</span> browser.

1. Navigate to the folder containing the files that you want to remove
   metadata from.

1. Select the files that you want to remove metadata from with the mouse.

1. Right-click (on Mac, click with two fingers) on the files and choose
   <span class="guimenuitem">Remove metadata</span>.
