Subject: Testing Tails {{version}}

Hi,

the Tails {{version}} images will soon be available for download
and manual testing.

I'll let you know once they're available.

Here's the pad for testing coordination:

    {{pad}}

Please "tag" tests that you are doing so we don't duplicate work.

Please test by Tuesday, 14:00 UTC.

I expect feedback on the pad but if you have questions, I'll try to be on XMPP.

After the release, feel free to report to <tails-accounting@boum.org>
the time you spent on these tests: you can get paid for them.

Thanks a lot in advance,
cheers!
